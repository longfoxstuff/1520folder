<h1>Welcome to the Syllabus for CIST 1520</h1>
	<p>Instructor: Paul Long, M Ed., A+, Net+</p>
	<p>Phone Number: </p>
	<p>Office: Parker Nellis, Room 115</p>

<h2>INSTRUCTIONAL METHODOLOGY:</h2>
	<p>In order to better provide students a convenient time to take the class, additional 
		instructional materials will be available online.&nbsp; However, the class is hybrid 
		because you will need to come in to the labs to complete most hands-on labs and 
		also to receive directed assignments to re-enforce reading assignments. The 
		instructional methodology will include the students completing weekly reading 
		assignments in the text and the additional instructional material included in 
		the online presentations, taking tests, working on a group class presentation, 
		preparing Work Ethics exercises and completing a course portfolios of all work 
		completed during the course.&nbsp; The portfolio and reflection statement to be included with the 
		portfolio allow the student to reflect on their work/efforts in the learning 
		environment.&nbsp; Assignments will be sent to the instructor via email or turned 
		into the instructor directly.&nbsp; Communication with the students will be continual 
		as required and will be via email or during class time. Additional help will be 
		available to students&rsquo; if needed outside of class. The classroom and lab room 
		will be made available for student use at times other than scheduled class time.</p>

	</ul>

<h3>REQUIREMENTS:</h3>
	<p>The course requires the attendance of course lectures
		and practical lab demonstration. Out of class work will be assigned each week, 
		as will out of class preparation for classes. Students are expected to demonstrate 
		knowledge, understanding and proficiency in the subject matter by successfully completing 
		written and lab assignments and written and/or practical tests.</p>
	<p>Students need to purchase the book required for the class, read the assigned readings, and

		The remaining 10% will be discretionary points. Nothing will be made up without a legitimate
		excuse.</p>
	<p>Immediate feedback for student code will be given via the HTML and CSS validators! Experience will 
		decrease both the need to do this and the number of errors present.</p>

	<p><u>You are expected to read each 
		assigned chapter prior to the lecture</u>!</p>
	<p>Weekly homework and laboratory assignments can only be 
		handed immediately <mark>BEFORE</mark> lecture 
		begins the following week. </p>
	<p>Make sure your name and exercise number appear 
		in the upper-left corner. If an exercise has multiple sheets, then staple them 
		together. Do not staple different assignments together. Disorganized assignments 
		(Pages out of order, mislabeled, unreadable, etc.) will receive a grade of zero. 
		If there are multiple sheets are to be handed in, then sequence them according 
		to the order you were told to print them in the exercise.</p>
	<p>No extra credit will be allowed unless all required assignments are completed!</p>
	<p>All students are required to submit a <strong><mark>graded</mark></strong> class participation rubric near the end of the semester!</p>

<h3>ATTENDANCE/MAKE-UP WORK POLICY:</h3>
	<p>One of the keys to student success in 
		college is class attendance. what happens in class is&nbsp; unique and is <strong><mark>not</mark></strong> 
		easily replaced by copying notes or reading the textbook.</p>
	<p>Nothing will be made up without a legitimate excuse.</p>
	<p>Students will meet 
		with the instructor two days per week.&nbsp; This time will be devoted to lecture, 
		presentations, labs,&nbsp; portfolios, question and answer sessions and projects.&nbsp;Students 
		should also access the CIST 1520 web site weekly at their convenience to check for 
		any changes in assignments.&nbsp; The instructor will be available to CIST 1520 
		students for help by email, telephone, or by face-to-face consultation during 
	regular office hours, during lunch, before and after class, on Fridays or by appointment.</p>
	<p>Using the Internet while lecture is taking place will result in a loss of one letter 
		grade: a second instance will result in a loss of two letter grades, therefore;

<h3>THE USE OF THE INTERNET, CHAT LINES, 
	AND E-MAIL DURING THIS CLASS LECTURE TIME IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED!!&nbsp; NO 
	EXCEPTIONS!</h3>
	<p>An <strong>Award</strong> for perfect attendance will be given to all students who attend 
		every class with no lateness's or leave early's.</p>

<h3>ACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY:</h3>
	<p>Students are expected to uphold the school&#39;s standard of 
		conduct relating to academic honesty. Students assume full responsibility for 
		the content and integrity of the academic work they submit. The guiding 
		principle of academic integrity shall be that a student's submitted work, 
		examinations, reports, and projects must be that of the student's own work. 
		Students shall be guilty of violating the honor code if they:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Represent the work of others as their own.</li>
		<li>Use or obtain unauthorized assistance in any academic work.</li>
		<li>Give unauthorized assistance to other students.</li>
		<li>Modify, without instructor approval, an 
				examination, paper, record, or report for the purpose of obtaining additional 
				credit.</li>
		<li>Misrepresent the content of submitted work.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The penalty for violating the 
		honor code is severe. Any student violating the honor code is subject to receive 
		a failing grade for the course and will be reported to the Office of Student 
		Affairs. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may 
		constitute an honor code violation, the student should meet with the instructor 
		to discuss the situation.</p>
	<p>For this class, it is 
		permissible to assist classmates in general discussions of computing techniques. 
		General advice and interaction are encouraged. Each person, however, must 
		develop his or her own solutions to the assigned homework and laboratory 
		exercises. Students may not &quot;work together&quot; on graded assignments. Such 
		collaboration constitutes cheating, unless it is a grouped assignment. A student 
		may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and 
		represent it as his/her own. If you need help on an assignment, contact your 
		instructor or the TA, not other classmates.</p>

<h3>COMPUTER USE POLICY :</h3>
<p>The Computer Use Policy was given to you at the departmental orientation your first 
	semester as a student in the department. A copy of the policy is in a pocket 
	folder located at the front of each of the computer labs for your reference.</p>

<h4>SAFETY:</h4>
	<p>The safety procedures and rules are posted on the bulletin boards in the 
		upstairs and downstairs hallways and at the front of each of the classrooms. The 
		safety procedures are in the packet of information that was given to you at the 
		departmental orientation your first semester as a student.&nbsp; Be sure to view the
		<a href="./files/DISASTERDRILLPROCEDURE.doc">disaster drill</a> information.</p>
